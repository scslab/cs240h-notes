A few things are copied from the actual lecture notes in places where my typing
couldn't keep up (mainly code samples).

# Safe Haskell

* How can we incorporate untrusted code in our programs?

* We often want to use 3rd party libraries (e.g., from Hackage), but we need to
* limit the damage they can do if they are malicious.

## How do we decide whether code is safe?

* We can't determine safety of functions just from type signatures.

* `unsafePerformIO` and others can do nasty things without making the
(potential) nastiness obvious in the type signature of the function.

* We need some way to trust the type signature (pure functions should actually be pure).

## Enter Safe Haskell

* Prevents your modules from importing "unsafe" modules

* Usage: `import safe ...`

* Can invoke GHC with `-XSafe` to force all imports to be safe.

* Forces compilation to fail if the import is not safe.

## Trusting packages

* Problem: useful modules often need to do "unsafe" operations, so we need a
way of asserting the safety of these operations.

* Module authors can compile with `-XTrustworthy`, which simply asserts that
the module is safe. This does not restrict the module's implementation from
doing unsafe things, (`unsafePerformIO`, `inlinePerformIO`, etc.), but does
force it to expose a safe interface.

* How does this help? Can't anyone just use -XTrustworthy?

* Users of these modules can decide whether to trust them.
    * `-fpackage-trust` enables per-package trust.
    * `-distrust` ignores `Trustworthy` for a specific package.
    * `-distrust-all-packages` ignores `Trustworthy` for all packages.

## Restricted I/O

* What if untrusted code needs to do I/O (that cannot be hidden behind a pure interface)?

* Implement "restricted" I/O with an `RIO` monad.
    * Implement `RIO` functions for specific capabilities, and implicitly
      disable all other forms of I/O by not implementing them for the `RIO` monad.
    * Use `newtype` to wrap `RIO` around `IO`, and export the type, but not the constructor.
    * Export `runRIO` to allow the `IO` action to be run, but this can only
      happen in the `RIO` monad, and hence it is safe.
    * Internally, the `RIO` implementation uses the `UnsafeRIO` constructor.
    * This means a user can't take an `IO` action and turn it into an `RIO` action, but can take an
      `RIO` action and turn it into an `IO` action, and therefore can only run `RIO` actions.

~~~ {.haskell}
runRIO :: RIO a -> IO a
~~~

Example: restrict access to particular network ports or files.

This isn't possible in many other languages, where we are always implicitly in the
`IO` monad.


# Decentralized Information Flow Control

## Why `RIO` isn't enough

* How can we prevent leaking private data on a website while still using 3rd party libraries to
manipulate that data?

* Consider a malicious `googleTranslate` function.

* We can use code that manipulates and stores private data in a sandbox, but the
implementor might have created a backdoor that returns the contents of the
sandbox when given a certain input.

## Information Flow Control (IFC)

* Military origins (managing classified data)
* The basics:
    * All data has a label.
    * All processes have a label.
    * The labels have a partial order.
    * A "can flow to" B, denoted: A ⊑ B.

* Examples:
    * If "file" ⊑ "emacs" then emacs can read the file.
    * If "emacs" ⊑ "file" then emacs can write to the file.
    * We often want both directions.

* Access control is transitive (one of the properties of partial orders).

* In IFC we have a lattice of labels.

Consider two users.

~~~
public : L_0
userA : L_A
userB : L_B
AandB : L_AB
~~~

`L_AB` is the least upper bound of `L_A` and `L_B`.

## *Decentralized* Information Flow Control

A DIFC system has a notion of privileges, which form a preorder on the "can flow to" (⊑)
operator.

Using privileges, users can declassify their own data and partially declassify data
higher on the lattice.

Under `A`'s privileges, the lattice collapses to (`L_0` + `L_A`) and (`L_B` + `L_AB`)
Under `B`'s privileges, the lattice collapses to (`L_0` + `L_B`) and (`L_A` + `L_AB`)

## Static implementation in Haskell

Encode a two point lattice in the type system.

~~~ {.haskell}
data L = Lpriv
data H = Hpriv
~~~

* Export types but not constructors.

* Constructors act like "keys" that can deconstruct the value, which would let users
circumvent the labels.

Use a multi-parameter typeclass to implement (⊑).

~~~ {.haskell}
-- multiparam typeclass extension
class Flows sl sh where
instance Flows L L
instance Flows L H
instance Flows H H

newtype Sec s a = MkSec a
instance Monad (Sec s) where
    return x = MkSec x
    MkSec a >>= k = k
~~~

Allow anyone to label a value but require the label's private constructor to
unlabel.

~~~ {.haskell}
label :: a -> Sec s a
label x = MkSec x
unlabel :: Sec s a -> s -> a
unlabel (MkSec a) s = s `seq` a -- need to force the privilege with seq, otherwise it won't be checked
~~~

There is only one valid value for each of the label types, namely the private
constructor, so if we don't have access to it, we can't call `unlabel` without
crashing (or just failing to compile). (We can pass `undefined` as the argument
`s`, but `seq` will force it and crash.)

Allow data to be relabeled if an instance of `Flows` exists for that ordered pair.

~~~ {.haskell}
relabel :: (Flows lin lout) => Sec lin a -> Sec lout a
relabel (MkSec val) = MkSec val
~~~

## Secure I/O

What if we need both the `Sec` and `IO` monads?

Is this code safe?
~~~ {.haskell}
untrustedTranslate :: Sec H L.ByteString -> Sec H (IO L.ByteString)
~~~
No, because the I/O action wrapped by `Sec` can be arbitrary, and might do
nasty things if we run it.

Solution: combine `Sec` and `RIO` into one monad, so that we can define what I/O is
allowed in the secure context.

~~~ {.haskell}
value :: Sec s a -> SecIO s a
value s a = MkSecIO (return sa)

plug :: Less sl sh => SecIO sh a -> SecIO sl (Sec sh a)

type File s = SecFilePath String

readFileSecIO :: File s -> SecIO s' (Sec s String)
~~~

New safe external query type signature:
~~~ {.haskell}
queryGoogle :: Sec H L.ByteString -> SecIO H L.ByteString
~~~

All enforcement done at compile time.

## Dynamic DIFC with `LIO`

* We may need to create new labels at runtime and enforce the DIFC properties on them.

* Idea: track both the current label and maximum label or "clearance".

* Associate an `LIOState` with each thread.

~~~ {.haskell}
data LIOState l = LIOSTate { lioLabel, lioClearance :: !l }

newtype LIO l a = LIOTCB (IORef (LIOState l) -> IO a)

instance Monad (LIO l) where
    return = LIOTCB . const . return
    (LIOTCB ma) >>= k = LIOTCB $ \s -> do
        a <- ma
        case k a of LIOTCB mb -> mb s


-- need back door from IO to LIO for privileged code
-- don't export this symbol
ioTCB :: IO a -> LIO l a
ioTCB = LIOTCB . const
~~~

* TCB = Trusted Computing Base


Encoding privileges:

~~~ {.haskell}
class (Typeable p, Show p) => SpeaksFor p where
    speaksFor :: p -> p -> Bool

downgradeP -- compute lowest equivalent label under some privilege
canFlowToP -- determine whether the downgrade of one label can flow to
~~~

How can we allow computation that encodes the fact that you have seen information
with a particular label?

~~~ {.haskell}
taint :: Label l => l -> LIO l ()
~~~

## Privileges vs. privilege descriptions

* We want to be able to name privileges in any context.

* There is an important difference between naming privileges and exercising them.

~~~ {.haskell}
newtype Priv a = PrivTCB a deriving (Show, Eq, Typeable)

instance Monoid p => Monoid (Priv p) where
  mempty = PrivTCB mempty
  mappend (PrivTCB m1) (PrivTCB m2) = PrivTCB $ m1 `mappend` m2

privDesc :: Priv a -> a
privDesc (PrivTCB a) = a

privInit :: p -> IO (Priv p)
privInit p = return $ PrivTCB p
~~~

* Can delegate privileges to someone else.

* Can wrap privileges in closures.

* Can use "Gates", which take privileges and return privilege descriptions, so
someone can require you to have privileges to do something, without forcing
you to delegate those privileges in order to prove that you have them.

Augmenting normal I/O actions with labels:

~~~ {.haskell}
{-# LANGUAGE Trustworthy #-}

import LIO.TCB.LObj

type LMVar l a = LObj l (MVar a)

takeLMVar :: Label l => LMVar l a -> LIO l a
takeLMVar = blessTCB "takeLMVar" takeMVar

tryTakeLMVar :: Label l => LMVar l a -> LIO l (Maybe a)
tryTakeLMVar = blessTCB "tryTakeLMVar" tryTakeMVar

putLMVar :: Label l => LMVar l a -> a -> LIO l ()
putLMVar = blessTCB "putLMVar" putMVar
~~~

## Applications using `LIO`

* Main application is Hails web framework
    * Really a framework for creating web platforms hosting mutually distrustful apps
* Example: GitStar (which is implemented with Hails)
    * Host potentially private git repositories
    * Functionality for third party extensions (e.g., syntax-highlighting) cannot leak private source code
* Ongoing research here at Stanford
